# syst-trading-research

Research repository on **systematic trading and backtesting**, built around signals generated by the models in the companion [`score-driven-filters`]

The goal of this repo is to bridge the gap between modelling and trading strats:
taking estimated score-driven models, turning them into portfolio weights, and evaluating them with realistic
risk management.

---

## What’s in here?

- **Score-driven signal → portfolio pipeline**  
  Strategies in this repo typically:
  1. Fit a (multi)variate **explicit score-driven model** to returns or spreads.
  2. Use out-of-sample forecasts (e.g. conditional means) as **signals**.
  3. Map signals to **long/short weights** with cross-sectional standardization and factor neutrality.
  4. Apply **risk scaling** via EWMA covariance estimates and volatility targeting.
  5. Evaluate **PnL, risk, and t-stats** in a walk-forward backtest.
